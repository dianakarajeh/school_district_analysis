# School District Analysis
Perform a reanalysis of PyCity Schools reading and math scores for ninth graders at Thomas High School in order to address the reporting of academic dishonesty to the school board.
## Project Overview
#### Maria, the Chief Data Scientist for PyCity School District, has been notified that there has been evidence of academic dishonesty when reporting the scores of math and reading standardized tests.  A thorough analysis was already done for all the schools in the PyCity School District with regards to math and reading scores for 9-12th graders.  After figuring out about the academic dishonesty, Maria decided her team had to reanalyze the data to ensure the Thomas High School ninth grade reading and math scores are accurately reported to the school district board.
## Results
#### - When the reanalysis for Thomas High School occurred, the district summary was slightly altered for Charter school type only since Thomas High School is a Charter School. Before reanalysis the district summary is seen below:
